# NASA-libcurl-CLI

An interactive CLI program that fetches NASA API's and outputs them in prettified JSON format (`.json` file and in terminal).

Written in C++ using the [libcurl API](https://curl.se/libcurl/) and [nlohmann json parser](https://github.com/nlohmann/json). My library [TermStylist](https://github.com/alexwkleung/TermStylist) was also used for terminal colours.

WIP.

Initially I was writing this in C but unfortunately I couldn't comprehend/understand how to parse JSON in it... I was going through a few JSON libraries and hours without success, so I decided to switch everything to C++ as a last resort. Maybe in the near future I'll be able to do this in pure C since that was my initial goal for this project.
